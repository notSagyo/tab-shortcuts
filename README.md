# Tab Shortcuts

Allows you to have a different set of hotkeys for pinned and unpinned tabs.

Change the shortcuts from: `about:addons > ⚙️ > Manage Extension Shortcuts`

- Navigate unpinned tabs with `Alt+Number` by default.
- Pinned tabs have no new shortcut by default.

You can assign `Ctrl+Number` as hotkeys but behaves a little strange as it will use first the browser's default shortcut and then the new one instantly.

# Zen Browser

Firefox extensions can't detect if a tab is essential or not, so you have to manually set how many essential tabs you're using by clicking the extension's icon and modifying the value in the popup.

- Essential tabs have no new shortcut by default.

You can assign `Ctrl+Number` as hotkeys but it's recommended that you change these hotkeys from Zen's settings first.
